# blog-app-backend
The blog application has many features like we can create post, comment and also reply back on someone's comment, delete your post. There are two roles admin and user, user can do all this thing but admin has more 
functionality than user admin can delete someone else post also.

It is based on Spring Boot for making apis, MySql for storing data and also use of Json web token. This is the backend of blog-application. You can test APIs with the help of postman.
